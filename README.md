# File-Explorer.NET
Self-Manage File Explorer with categorize files

(At the moment, I just upload the old source code)

The project made in 2010 with C# on VS 2010 for a purpose to manage the file drag&drop to each category.

It's just making link database to a real file system, it does not store file on this application database.
It was supposed to use to manage media files and software installer or package files.
