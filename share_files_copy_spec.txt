Application specification:
=================
Goal: Fetch all files in all windows drives or from share folder drive, filter by file extensions. Possibly to copy those files to any destination

How to manage the application?
======================
- Give 2 options: Local windows share (to select drive to search) or network share
- The file paths will store in text file according to following template:
     - local_[pc_name]_drive_c
     - share_[pc_name]_drive or share_[pc_name]_[folder_share_name]
- Database files save data or remove data only when we go to syncronize
- For option data we need another text file

1. Local Windows share
When we choose this option, will list all windows drives. So you need to decide which drive you need to filter and search your expected files.
After decided, just click on search so all file path will be search and save into the database in order to use.
Note for this option, you may only use to share files in local PC only, not to cross the network.

2. Network share
Click on network share, you need to make sure that your PC is already in the same domain or the same Workgroup.
To know this go to right click on My Computer -> Computer Name, you may find, the domain name or workgroup name as well.

You can put a share pc to search or you can search all available network share that your PC can access.
Then you will need to decide which share foldername to use for searching or click ALL to search
Finally click on Search to go.


Copy Interface:
============
Two list: Source and destination
Just select file paths at sources and send to destination
